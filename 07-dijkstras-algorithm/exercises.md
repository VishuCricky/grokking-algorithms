1. In each of these graphs, what is the weight of the shortest path from start to finish?

![graphs for exercise 7.1](exercise-7.1.png)

  > The graphs for these problems are stored in `graph-a.json` and `graph-b.json` respectively. Dijkstra's Algorithm is run on these graphs, and the output checked, in `dijkstrasAlgorithm.test.js`.

  > In graph C there is no shortest path, because one of the edges has a negative weight (`-1`).

  > In graph A, the shortest path from the start node to the finish node has a weight of `8`.

  > In graph B, the shortest path from the start node to the finish node has a weight of `60`.
