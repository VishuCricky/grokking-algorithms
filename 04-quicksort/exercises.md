1. Write out the code for the recursive `sum` function.

  > See the code in `sumRecursive.js` and its test in `sumRecursive.test.js`.

2. Write a recursive function to count the number of items in a list.

  > See the code in `countRecursive.js` and its test in `countRecursive.test.js`.

3. Find the maximum number in a list.

  > See the code in `maxRecursive.js` and its test in `maxRecursive.test.js`.

4. Remember binary search from chapter 1? Itâ€™s a divide-and-conquer algorithm, too. Can you come up with the base case and recursive case for binary search?

  > See the code in `binarySearchRecursive.js` and its test in `binarySearchRecursive.test.js`. The base case is one in which the middle item in the array is equal to the target, in which case we simply return the index of that item. In the recursive case, we check whether the middle value is high or low, and then run the binary search on just the lower or upper half of the array accordingly. The search algorithm also has `start` and `end` parameters so as to maintain the indexes of the original array.
